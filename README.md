ABOUT
=====
	Summer, it's a time for outdoor activity. During the summers, everyone wants to be out and about whether it be, basking in the sun at the beach or feeling the wind gusts at the top of a mountain. People want to go camping, hiking, play sports, and dare to adventure. This is why it can be really frustrating when going out isn't an option, because of the extreme global warming affecting the entire planet right now

	Wouldn't it be nice to avoid all the fuss? Plan a trip somewhere, with the confidence that the weather will be perfect for all your activities. How many more trips would you go on if you could plan better for the weather? If only it was that easy...
