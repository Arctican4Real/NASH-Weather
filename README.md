  Summer time, it's a time of outdoor activity. During summers, everyone wants to be out and about, basking in the sun and feeling the gusts of wind. People want to go camping, go hiking, play sports, and dare to adventure. That's why it can reallly frustrating when going out isn't an option, because of it being too hot! 

  Wouldn't it be nice to avoid all the fuss? Plan a trip somewhere, with the confidence that the weather will be perfect? How many more trips would you go on if you could plan better for the weahter. If only it was that easy...
